        <h2>Position Paper Supporting the Theory That Our World Has Entered the Period of Global Warming </h2>
        <p>It is proven that the Earth has a climate cycle. There is a period where the global average temperature is high, and a period where the global average temperature is low. Astronomer Milutin Milankovitch proposed that the cycle of hot and cold temperatures was caused by cyclic changes in the Earth’s eccentricity, precession, and axial tilt. He calculated that an Ice Age will occur once every 41 000 years. Future studies confirmed that in the past one to three million years, an Ice Age occurred in 41 000-year intervals. However, about 800 000 years ago, the Ice Age intervals increased to 100 000 years, synchronizing with Earth’s eccentricity cycle. Theories have been proposed to explain this synchronization, but scientist have no clear answer yet. <br>
            <br>Earth’s last Ice Age was around 11 700 years ago. Currently, the Earth is in the stage where its average surface temperature will get warmer. But in the last century, the rise in temperature is faster than the last cycle’s rise in temperature. Scientists believe that this unusually high rise in temperature is caused by human activities. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Such activities release copious quantities of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Usually, the Earth naturally release excess heat into space. But greenhouse gases trap the heat inside Earth in a process called the “Greenhouse Effect”. In addition, the greenhouse gases also tear holes in the ozone layer. The ozone layer protects Earth’s surface from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. If the too much ultraviolet rays hit the surface, it also warms up the planet. These phenomena cause the Earth’s temperature to rise in a way that is not coordinated with the Earth’s climate cycle. The unnatural rise in temperature will have severe consequences if not controlled soon. <br>
            <br>According to Milankovitch’s cycle, it is too early for Earth to be this warm. Many experts are already producing solutions to the problems that cause global warming. But some experts believe that this temperature is the correct temperature for this stage in the cycle. In fact, they believe that it is still too cold, and the Earth will still get warmer as the centuries go by, with or without human activities.<br>
            <br>The Earth is already getting warmer, and it is already too warm for this time. One of the scientific concepts on why the Greenhouse effect and tearing of the Ozone layer heats the Earth up is Thermochemistry. Specifically, the concept of Enthalpy.  <br>
            <br>Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity that is equal to the total heat content of a system. It is shown that the increase in global temperatures is correlated with the increase in the production of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases do not only trap heat, but it also produces it. One of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere is methane. Methane has an enthalpy of reaction of -890.9 kJ/mol. A negative enthalpy means the reaction is exothermic, it releases heat. The heat released by methane can easily heat up the environment. Which in turn increase Earth’s surface temperature. The increase in temperature can tear the ozone layer due to heat expansion. The weakened ozone layer allows more ultraviolet rays to reach Earth’s surface, causing it to warm up. <br>
            <br>The increase of greenhouse gas emissions is directly proportional to the sudden increase in Earth’s surface temperature. The exothermic reactions of the production and emission of greenhouse gases can warm the Earth and tear the ozone layer through heat expansion.  <br>
