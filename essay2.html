        <h2>How The Spongebob Sqaurepants the Movie Changed the Course of My Childhood</h2>
        <p>I was a weird kid, and I had no complaints about it. Whenever I am in a room, I am either the center of attention or at the corner of the room; there is nothing in between. I was pure chaos every time I played with my friends. Throwing balls at random places, scratching cars using a toy car, creating weird games that no kid on the planet has ever played before. I might have been the kid that other parents warn their children not to hang out with. Everything I did was just so out of place. But guess what, I loved my childhood. I was enjoying my life, more than I ever could nowadays. I would give up all my memories, lessons, and achievements if it means I get to be three years old ang grow up all over again.<br>
            <br>My childhood memories are getting foggy now that I am becoming an adult. But I still have a lot of moments and memories inside me; one of which is SpongeBob SquarePants. The show was one of the very first cartoons I watched when I was a kid. I love it deeply. Whenever my parents needed a break from taking care of me, they would just put me on my highchair and turn the TV on to Spongebob Sqarepants. I would just sit there glued to the screen yet at a safe distance to not burn my retinas. I would watch the show for hours on end while laughing at every funny moment even though I barely had any cognitive ability to know what was going on in the show. All I know is that it was a hilarious show. My parents appreciated it whenever I watched Spongebob because they knew I was doing something I loved, and they never had to deal with any toddler troubles, like screaming, crying, and throwing, during that time. But when the show ends and the end credits roll out, I would cry like I never cried before. My mom told me that I would cry harder at the end credits than whenever I was hungry or had a full diaper. That is saying something because I rarely cried when I was a baby.<br>
            <br>My parents knew that my love for Spongebob was set in stone. They bought me Spongebon toys and accessories. The best one is the DVD of the first three seasons. They bought them so I can watch my beloved show whenever I wanted. I was six or seven years old when I learned to operate our DVD player. Since I know how to use it, I would watch Spongebob DVDs every chance I get. From after finishing my homework to free time on the weekend. I would watch it repeatedly even after I finish the whole DVD. As I get older, I notice that how I viewed the show was different. I used to laugh at it whenever flashy colors pop up or when Spongebob laughs. But for every stage of development my brain undergoes, I finally gained a deeper understanding of their dialogues, jokes, and later, the “adult” jokes. <br>
            <br>Since my community back then did not have any theaters, we found out about The Spongebob Sqarepants: The Movie a little too late. I could not watch it on the big screen anymore, so I just waited for the DVD to come out. The moment my parents realized there was a copy for sale, they immediately bought it. I was so excited to have it. I thought to myself “Yehey, more Spongebob!”. I decided to watch it on the first day of summer. My dad put the DVD on the player, and I sat down as if I was going to watch a regular Spongebob Squarepants episode. I realized that it was not a regular episode once I noticed that it was longer than twenty minutes. The Pattywagon was the first thing that caught my eye. It was one of my clearest first memories about the movie. It was like the piece that would always make me remember that this movie exists. As the movie progressed, I felt emotions that I had never felt before. Seeing Spongebob’s town in such a predicament and thinking about how Spongebob is on his biggest mission yet. I have seen plot and storylines that I have never seen in a kid’s show before. I never expected my favorite underwater character to go to dry land. To me, it was like watching an astronaut exploring the ends of the universe. The ending is also phenomenal and satisfying. I am not going to include any more details about the film. But I will include one thing so I will not spoil it any further. But I will say this, it made me love being a kid. <br>
            <br>The real highlight was when Spongebob said “This is the greatest day of my life!”. Because after he said that the end credits rolled and “Ocean Man” by Ween started playing. During which I felt a burst of emotions that were new to me. I cried just like in every moment I see and hear the end credits. But for some reason, it felt different. Tears were running down from my face, but I was not screaming in sadness. I just felt like crying, letting all my emotions out. I did not know what to do, I did not want to run to my parents for help. I just laid on my bed as the lengthy end credits rolled. This planted the song Ocean Man into my head. Now, whenever I hear it, I feel the exact emotions I did when I first heard it. It is a song I would listen to whenever I have confusing thoughts and I did not know what to do. <br>
            <br>Looking back, I may have felt my very first “All good things must come to an end” feeling. The same emotions everyone feels whenever they finish a good movie, show, or book. It was like I matured but not really. I was too young. It was as if my emotions flew out of my brain and jumped back in. I was a different kid after watching that movie. Before, I was like a toddler with no thoughts and feelings. The ones I did have were eat, sleep, play, scream, repeat. But afterwards, I felt like I needed to enjoy my childhood. I became more active and friendly. I learned from my mistakes. I even felt terrible for putting my parents and house helpers in such inconvenient situations. Although I still had difficulties perceiving the world around me, I did my best to make sense of it. <br>
            <br>Growing up as a kid, I was a little strange, but I never had any complaints about it. Whenever I was in a room, I was either the center of attention or chilling in the corner, there was no in-between. I was pure chaos every time I played with my friends. I would always play games with so much energy and yelling. My parents must have been worried about me, but I was just a happy-go-lucky kid who enjoyed every moment of my life. I cherish these memories so much that I would give up all I learned, all I accomplished, and all I experienced if it meant that I could relive my childhood again.<br>
            <br>One of my most significant childhood memories is watching SpongeBob SquarePants. It was one of the very first cartoons I watched when I was young, and I loved it deeply.

My dad put the DVD on the player, and I sat down as if I was going to watch a regular SpongeBob SquarePants episode. But as the movie progressed, I felt emotions that I had never felt before.
